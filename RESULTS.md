# Performance Results
Here are the throughput and average response time metrics for the three scenarios outlined in the assignment description:

One client pair:

    throughput: 3.0992730411977374
    average response time: 0.009425467332204182
    
Ten client pairs:

    throughput: 16.40571589703376
    average response time: 0.16181823141496812
    
100 client pairs: 

    throughput: N/A
    average response time: 0.6769386267312599
    
 Note that in the ten and 100 client pairs scenarios, some of the processes seemd to die, as not all of them reported their average response time.
